Multimedia Keys are working without FN

Actual F keys are working with Shift key (Shift+F)

Just add the path to your mail client and your calculator, but even if you don't everything else works as expected.

Install the programs below to ryn everything out of the box, or configure the file acording to your needs.

Music player: https://www.spotify.com/gr/download/windows/
Calculator: https://winaero.com/blog/get-calculator-from-windows-8-and-windows-7-in-windows-10/
Mail Client: https://www.emclient.com/download

Tip!

If you need the default apps from Windows 10, for mail, calculator and music, the solution is to make shortcuts to a folder of your choice and then link those to F1, F9 and F12 keys

Run "shell: Apps folder" -> Right click -> Create shortcut -> Move it to the location of your choice -> Copy path to F key according to the instructions
