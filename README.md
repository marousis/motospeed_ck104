Multimedia Keys are working without FN

Actual F keys are working with Shift

Just add the path to your mail client and your calculator, but even if you don't everything else works as expected.

Tip!

If you need the default apps from Windows 10, for the mail and the calculator the solution is to make shortcuts to a folder of your choice and then link those to F9 and F12 keys

Run "shell: Apps folder" -> Right click -> Create shortcut -> Move it to the location of your choice -> Copy path to F key according to the instructions
